# Unscented Kalman Filter Project
This is the project that belongs to the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program. This project includes the UKF implementation to process generated Lidar and Radar data to estimate the state of a simulated vehicle.

Main code is to check out are: `src/ukf.cpp`, `src/tools.cpp`.
